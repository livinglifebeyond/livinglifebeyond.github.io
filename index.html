            <h2>Transforming the Workforce: Introducing a Platform for Second-Chance Employment</h2>
            <p>LifeBeyond is a platform designed to bridge the gap between organizations helping ex-offenders and
                employers who are open to second-chance hiring. Based on our research, we know many ex-offenders face
                barriers re-entering society, even though they often possess the skills, motivation, and dedication to
                succeed. At the same time, many employers are currently facing labor shortages despite the valuable
                talent
                pool that is available. Our platform seeks to provide a solution to both those problems.</p>
